### Looking for the emulated automatic watering system?

You can run the following custom kernels assembled for each device on QEMU or ARM FastModel.

- [Kernel-Moisture](https://github.com/0xTinkertoy/Kernel-Moisture)
- [Kernel-Actuator](https://github.com/0xTinkertoy/Kernel-Actuator)
- [Kernel-Gateway](https://github.com/0xTinkertoy/Kernel-Gateway)

Emulation companions:

- [ARM FastModel](https://github.com/0xTinkertoy/ARM-FastModel-LM3S811EVB-Nano) (Subscription Required)
- [Emulation Controller](https://github.com/0xTinkertoy/EmulationController)

### Looking for the internals?

Our journey never ends, because there remains much potential for Tinkertoy.  
You can find the following sample code that demonstrates the core design concept of each module.  
Note that constraints (C++20 concepts) are "ubiquitous". :)
